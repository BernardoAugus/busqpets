Quasar Starter Kit for Meteor

This is a resource which will show how to install Quasar inside the Meteor framework, with Vue2 also installed.

So far Quasar has been shown to work successfully in browsers in a Meteor application. 
Whereas mobile/Cordova has issues which we hope can be solved in a reasonable time-span.
