# quasar-template-meteor
Quasar Starter Kit for Meteor

(Updated 29th August 2017).
#### Now installing properly from npm

Quasar 0.13.9

Meteor 1.5.1

This is a resource which will show how to install Quasar inside the Meteor framework, with Vue2 also installed.
First of all, this was forked from **https://github.com/Akryum/meteor-vue2-example-routing**
and then we added Quasar to that. So thankyou to Akryum for making Meteor work with Vue. - Amazing work.

###Installation 

**clone this repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-template-meteor.git
```

**cd into the 'template' folder:**
```
cd template
```

**Install from npm**

```
meteor npm install --save
```


**run meteor (still in the template folder)**

```
meteor
```

———————

Then it should say:
App running at: http://localhost:3000/

Point your desktop browser to that address.

———————

Quasar is also perfect for mobile apps, and this template will work there.
Please refer to guide.meteor.com/mobile.html for how to launch mobile apps on IOS and Android.

Note: The 'template' folder is necessary for the *quasar cli* command to function. 
All meteor commands should be run from inside the 'template' folder.

**Problems:**

1) I've copied the Material Design icons and the Roboto font to the /public folder.
There may be a better way of doing this.
