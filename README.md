# app-template-meteor
Quasar Starter Kit for Meteor

(Updated 10th July 2017).
#### Now installing properly from npm

Quasar 0.13.9

Meteor 1.5

This is a resource which will show how to install Quasar inside the Meteor framework, with Vue2 also installed.
First of all, this was forked from **https://github.com/Akryum/meteor-vue2-example-routing**
and then we added Quasar to that. So thankyou to Akyrum for making Meteor work with Vue. - Amazing work.

###Installation 

**clone this repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-template-meteor.git
```

**Install from npm**

```
meteor npm install --save
```


**run meteor**

```
meteor
```

Then it should say:
App running at: http://localhost:3000/

Point your desktop browser to that address.

———————

This app is actually made for mobile (both Android and IOS), so it doesn't look up to much on desktop.
You can see how it would look by clicking on the mobile phone icon in Chrome Dev Tools. 
Then change something in the code to make it do a hot-code push, so that the screen updates.

Please refer to guide.meteor.com/mobile.html for how to launch mobile apps on IOS and Android.

**Problems:**

1) I've copied the Material Design icons and the Roboto font to the /public folder.
There may be a better way of doing this.
